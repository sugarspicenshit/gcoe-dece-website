                    in the process.
                    Computational photography is a field of study that pushes for the capture or extraction of
                    information beyond what the
                    typical camera can capture, effectively producing photographs which cannot be taken using a normal

                    tackles some of the problems under computational photography along with potential solutions to the
                    said problems. In
                    particular, we look at the image acquisition process, image fusion techniques, resizing and
